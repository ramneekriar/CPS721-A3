% Explanation
% T and O are the letters that the majority depend on, so they are guessed early
% The main letters of CHAIRS use each other with the combination of T, O and W. 
% These terms are calculated as they comment
% WARTS/STRAW letters are already computed by this PROPOSITIONS
% Verify that all letters have unique numbers at the end
